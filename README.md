# 🌐🚀 Ground2Metaverse API

## Overview
The **Ground2Metaverse API** bridges the physical world (sensors, people, environments) to the **metaverse** using real-time data, AI reasoning, and quantum-enhanced translation layers. It enables physical entities, devices, and actions to sync with virtual constructs, avatars, economies, and spaces.

> “From the soil to the simulation — one interface to unify both planes.”

## 🔧 Features

- **🌍 Real-World Sync:** Pull in GPS, biometrics, weather, and environment data.
- **🧠 Cognitive Mapper:** Translate human intent and emotion into avatar behaviors.
- **⏳ Quantum Time Drift:** Allow time-stretched or compressed state mirroring.
- **🎮 Metaverse Control Hooks:** Push data to metaverse platforms (e.g. Decentraland, Spatial, custom VR worlds).
- **🔐 Auth + Identity Bridge:** Verify user presence both physically and virtually using biometric-quantum hashes.

## 🧪 API Endpoints

### `POST /location/sync`
Synchronize geolocation from ground to metaverse coordinates.

```json
{
  "lat": 26.9124,
  "lon": 75.7873,
  "avatar_id": "deep_neo01"
}
```

### `POST /emotion/stream`
Feed human mood or mental state to affect avatar gestures or environment.

```json

{
  "user_id": "deep_neo01",
  "emotion": "calm",
  "intensity": 0.8
}
```
### GET /metaverse/state
Retrieve current virtual scene state for a specific ground-linked session.

🛡️ Security & Identity
🔗 Uses quantum fingerprints for unique user-device verification.

👁️‍🗨️ Encrypted multi-layer presence model to prevent identity duplication across realms.

### ⚙️ Use Cases
AR Smart Cities – Citizens interact with both smart infrastructure and its metaverse twin.

Fitness Worlds – Real steps and workouts shape a gamified avatar journey.

Ritual Simulation – Physical rituals or ceremonies echoed into metaverse realms.

Earth Rebuilding Simulations – Model real land changes in virtual ecosystems.

### 🌌 Philosophy
"The metaverse is not an escape. It is a mirror. Ground2Metaverse is the interface where reality reflects, evolves, and multiplies."
